                    When space is introduced into the game and players are surrounded by neighbours, we see much more fairer outcomes!

                <p id="game-info-rps" class="game-info">Rock-Paper-Scissors works great for deciding who has to take out the garbage. But have you ever noticed what happens when, instead of playing best of three, you just let the game continue round after round? 
                    At first, you play a pattern that gives you the upper hand, but then your opponent quickly catches on and turns things in her favor. 
                    As strategies evolve, a point is reached where neither side seems to be able to improve any further. Why does that happen?

                <p id="game-info-schelling" class="game-info">
                    In 1971, the American economist Thomas Schelling created an agent-based model that suggested inadvertent behavior might also contribute to segregation. His model of segregation showed that even when individuals (or "agents") 
                    didn't mind being surrounded or living by agents of a different race or economic background, they would still choose to segregate themselves from other agents over time! Although the model is quite simple, 
                    it provides a fascinating look at how individuals might self-segregate, even when they have no explicit desire to do so.

                <p id="game-info-ulti" class="game-info">
                    The ultimatum game is a game that has become a popular instrument of economic experiments. An early description is by Nobel laureate John Harsanyi in 1961. One player, the proposer, is endowed with a sum of money. 
                    The proposer is tasked with splitting it with another player, the responder. Once the proposer communicates his decision, the responder may accept it or reject it. If the responder accepts, the money is split per the proposal; 
                    if the responder rejects, both players receive nothing. Both players know in advance the consequences of the responder accepting or rejecting the offer.

                <p id="game-info-stag" class="game-info">
                    The stag hunt problem originated with philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his Discourse on Inequality. In Rousseau's telling, two hunters must decide separately, and without the other knowing, whether to hunt a stag or a hare. 
                    However, both hunters know the only way to successfully hunt a stag is with the other's help. One hunter can catch a hare alone with less effort and less time, but it is worth far less than a stag and has much less meat. 
                    Rousseau therefore posits it would be much better for each hunter, acting individually, to give up total autonomy and minimal risk, which brings only the small reward of the hare. 
                    Instead, each hunter should separately choose the more ambitious and far more rewarding goal of getting the stag, thereby giving up some autonomy in exchange for the other hunter's cooperation and added might.

                    The game of chicken, also known as the hawkâ€“dove game or snowdrift game, is a model of conflict for two players in game theory. 
                    The principle of the game is that while the ideal outcome is for one player to yield (to avoid the worst outcome if neither yields), the individuals try to avoid it out of pride for not wanting to look like a "chicken". 
                    Each player taunts the other to increase the risk of shame in yielding. However, when one player yields, the conflict is avoided, and the game is for the most part over.
